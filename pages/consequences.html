        <p>There are few to no consequences for repair and right to repair, the consequences however only affect
            manufacturers. 
        </p>
        <h2>Why it is a Problem</h2>
        <p id="whyProblem">
            Repair is a problem because not repairing creates e-waste, which has variety of problems. 
            It’s also a problem because it uses up finite resources so much faster. 
            Another problem with it is that companies like Samsung, Apple, and Google, refuse to give schematics to devices, parts, etc, to devices for repair. 
            Even now the new apple iPhone 12 will break if you replace the camera with one from another iPhone 12 because they’re serialised.
