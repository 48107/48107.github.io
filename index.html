        <p>
            Repair is an idea that that you can repair devices, rather than throwing them away and being forced to have them replaced.
        </p>
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            Solutions to this could be having bills passed to force companies to sell parts, give schematics, and not put features in place to make repair difficult. 
            Even now in Massachusetts repair bills have passed for automotive businesses.
        </p>
        <h2>My Opinion</h2>
        <p>
            In my opinion repair is better for the world because it stops the world from becoming to much of a throwaway one.
